This past summer I had the privelege to bike across the country with [MIT Spokes](https://www.mitspokes.com/). It was a 74-day student-led trip, starting in Washington, D.C., and ending in San Francisco. Along the way, we stopped at schools, libraries, camps, and even a correctional facility to teach STEM topics based on our personal interests.

When planning my lesson, I knew I wanted it to be as hands-on as possible. I decided to teach about the physics of sound by having each student build their own speaker. From there, I had the task of manufacturing 200 speaker kits for the summer.  

I jumped into Onshape and got to designing. You can check out my CAD [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/015f2856481676e293bc01e8/w/6aee0ff4c8c9109735c1bf18/e/4a869af1912622972d755f94?renderMode=0&uiState=6715c107067ce37201965e73). My main goal was to create a part that would be quick to print in batches and clearly demonstrate the inner workings of a speaker.

After printing the parts, I built the rest of the speaker using a magnet, magnet wire, cardboard, superglue, a Bluetooth audio module, and a custom vinyl sticker that I designed and printed on campus. One of the biggest challenges when making these speakers is creating hand winding the solenoid. Hereâ€™s what the finished product looked like:

Next, it was time to mass-produce the kits. I was lucky enough to have three Bambu Lab X1-Carbon 3D printers at my disposal, allowing me to print 12 speakers per batch. This meant I could make 36 speakers every four hours.

Once the prints were complete, I packed the speaker parts into bags with instructions and other materials.

Here is a minifridge car full of speaker kits for refrence. This was not even all of the kits!

During the MIT Spokes trip, I distributed these kits to students, giving them something to take home. It was incredibly rewarding to see the students' excitement when their speakers worked and watch them dance to music.

This project made last summer one of the best experiences of my life. This only made saying goodbye to everyone on the team when we reached San Francisco harder.
